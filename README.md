# CS2 Anti-Cheat / TB Anti-Cheat
Anticheat plugin for Counter-Strike 2 based on CounterStrikeSharp. It is heavily inspired by SourceMod Anti-Cheat. It is currently in heavy development.

## Features / Roadmap
- [x] Basic aimbot detection (Only rage)
- [ ] Backtrack
- [ ] EyePosition Manipulation
- [ ] Rapid-Fire
- [ ] Bunnyhop
- [ ] Anti-Wallhack? (Depends on how limited we are with CS2 - technical speaking it might not be possible without hooking into the engine, too much work, etc)

## Installation
